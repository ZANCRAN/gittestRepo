commands: hostnamectl set-hostname server name

compress and decompress file ( zip and unzip)

goal : reduce files and fast the transfer

tar commands
---------------------
ll
tar : does not compress the file but archive
 touch hello world ( create 2 files) 

tar -cf helloworld.tar hello world ( create a copy of hello and world in helloworld.tar)
tar -tf  helloworld.tar ( display the 2 files in shell)
tar -tvf helloword.tar ( verbose display more info such date, ....)
tar -xf helloworld.tar   ( extract the two files from helloworld.tar) do not appear in the shell
tar -xvf helloworld.tar ( same as previous but display in the shell)
cat helloworld.tar  cannot cat this files

cat/etc/passwd >> world ( append the file world wit the content of passwd
ls -l /etc/ >> hello ( same appending)

du -sh* ( display shell)

tar -cvzf helloword.tar.gz hello world ( zip the files using gzip
tar -cvjf helloword.tar.bz2 ( zip the file using bzip )tar

gunzip helloworld.tar.gz ( unzip and return the original tar file with it size)  gzip

two types of backup : incremental and full backup

extract and uncompress the files 
tar -xvzf helloword.tar.gz
tar -xvjf helloword.tar.bz2

tgz = .tar.gz ( same thing)

tar --help ( display tar options)

star commands ( need to be install)
-------------
dnf command only redhat 8 to install package ( dnf install star)
yum install star ( yum work with all redhat, centos, ....)
yum clean all???

yum repolist all
yum epel

how to install star commands in rock 9 and alma 8

star -c f=archive.tar file1, file2
rm -rf file* ( remove all files)
start -t f=archive.tar ( display the content of the archive file)

----------------------------------------------------------
I don't always need tar to compress my file, I can compress any file directly

gzip file1 ( compress)
gzip -d  file1.gz ( unzip)
gunzip file1.gz ( unzip) return to the tar file

zip commands ( work like tar)
---------------

bzip2 commands ( work like gzip)
---------------

Download apache -nifi
ping website
wget website/zip file

kafka jobs ( java kafka) ??/ knowing those tools
nifi jobs??

create hard and soft link
-----------------------------------------------------------
soft link: symlinks is a soft link that connect one file to another symbolically ( inode are different)

ln -s /root/charly.txtx /tmp/california  ( r =4, w=2, x = 1 rwxrwxrwx 777 symlinks permission)
in tmp directory california will point to charly,txt
symlinks always start with l
if we move the target, the symlink will act like it is looking for the target ( become red)

hard link : default permission 664 ( -rw--r--r
ln 
hard link does not show any target and remain having the same content even though we move or delete the pointing file
inode are like 35245877 and are the same
================================================
difference between hardlink and softlink  ???
===================================================

File and directory permission
the first - is the type of directory/file/links
-rw-r--r--
rw- (owner or user permission)
r--( group of the users using the file)
r--(other, everyone else)

r = readeable  w= writeable x = executable - = denied

change mod command : chmod

owner : u ( first three)
group : g  ( second three)
o : other ( last three) 



12/23/2022
=============================================================================================
octal bits
r = 4 ( read)
w = 2 (write)
x = 1 ( execute)

example : chmod 600 filename ( octa mode) 

          6 ( first three which means permissions r =4 + w = 2, so rw-)
          0 ( second three which means  permissions denied three times ---)
          0 ( last three which means  permissions denied three times ---)
so the previous command will lead to the following permission -rw- --- ---

chmod 777 filename to give all permission to everybody


chmod example alaphanumeric mode
To add the permission execute on the user on the file charly.txt that have -rw- r-- r--
we run : chmod u+x charly.txt
To add the permission execute on the user, group and other, on the file charly.txt that have -rw- r-- r--
we run : chmod ugo+x charly.txt
To retrieve the permission execute on the user on the file charly.txt that have -rw- r-- r--
we run : chmod u-x charly.txt
chmod u+rw, g+r-x, o-rwx ?? permission r and x will be add to group
chmod a+x add executable permission to all three types of users

# change owner and group
cmd:
chown <<newonwer name>> filename or directory name
chown root charly.txt ( root becomes the owner of charly.txt)

groupadd <<groupname>> to add a group
ex: groupadd finance
tips : usermod command allow to modify user account info
usermod -a -G finance student ( add student to group finance)
id student ( return student and group iDs)

chown student.finance charly.txt ( change the owner and the group at the same time) or 
chown student : finance charly.txt

to change only the group, do chown .finance charly.txt

Note: changing the group of a folder do not change the group of it content..unless we use the
recursive. for example let say charly.txt is in the directory class5

chown -R.finance class5 will change the folder class5 group to finance and every file or folder inside class5 will 
therefore have finance as group


To change the group ownweship, you can run
chgrp <new owner name>  <filename or folder>

# Setuid : set user ID permission on executable file (x permission on that file will be replaced by s)
if permission line for owner look like -rwx------, then run
chmod u+xs filename.txt or chmod 4700 filename.txt ( le chiffre 4 set id), after the user permission will be -rws------
note : go online to get sample of linux system info script, crearte a vim file with extension sh and paste the script, this is an example 
of executable file, but we will need permission to run that file.
To run the script file name system-info.sh, do ./system-info.sh

#Setgid : set group permission on executable file
chmod 671 filename ( put group level to 7 which means rwx)
now run chmod 2671 ( the 2 at the begining will replace group x to s)
we can also run chmod g+rwxs to do the same thing

If we have to setuid and setgid on the same file using octal mode, we need to add 4+2 = 6 before the rest of the three digit



/////  How to run without setuid and setgid ///////
why setuid and setgid : because we want some users or group to execute a file withoiut being root or sudo or having super privileges
cmd : ps -ef ( process on linux use setuid/setgid)

ls /etc/shadow is the file where we see all the users passwords . Once the user update his password, it will be updated in the shadow file
cat ls /etc/shadow | grep prince ( will select the line having prince)


# sticky bit : a bit set on a directory that allow only the owner or the root can delete file and subdirectory. File can be written in that directory by anyone.
for example the folder having the permission drwxrwxrwt has sticky bit due to the letter t at the end
ex: chmod 1777 filename or  chmod o+t filename ( create sticky bit on the other level, 1 in the front for other, 2 for setgid, 4 for setuid)
chmod o-t filename (remove sticky bit)
create 2 folders in /tmp in the root and try to remove them ...permission will be denied


/////// UMASK////////////////////////////
UMask controi the default permission with no execute permission while directory has execute permission per default.

Umask default permission 0022 for root,  0002 for non privilege user, for a new created  directory 0777 and for files 0666
